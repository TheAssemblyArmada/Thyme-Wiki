Hello and welcome to the Thyme wiki.  

In time we hope to grow this wiki to capture as much information about the Thyme engine (and by extension the SAGE engine) as possible.  
This will include technical information such as file formats and engine details as they are worked out, as well as more generally useful information such as FAQs, how tos, modding guides and such.  

## Pages

These are mostly placeholders as the wiki is very much a work in progress.
